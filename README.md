## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for the master's thesis project titled: *"A Generic AI-Based Framework for IMU-Based Food Intake Gesture Detection."*

### Research Background
Maintaining a balanced dietary intake is essential for a high-quality lifestyle and is instrumental in preventing numerous eating-related diseases affecting millions globally. Issues such as malnutrition, metabolic disorders, and obesity are common consequences of unbalanced diets, underlining the importance of tracking dietary intake.

Recent research has explored the use of novel sensors for food intake behavior monitoring. Various sensors, including acoustic, camera, Electromyography (EMG), and inertial sensors, have been tested for this purpose. Among these, inertial sensors, commonly embedded in smartwatches and other wearables, have gained popularity due to their accessibility. However, detecting eating gestures with IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors is challenging due to sensitivity to device orientation, often resulting in models that perform poorly on data from different orientations.

### Thesis Objective
The objective of this thesis is to design a generic AI-based framework to process IMU data for food intake gesture detection, minimizing the impact of sensor orientation differences. This will involve:

1. Conducting a thorough literature review on food intake behavior monitoring with a focus on IMU sensors.
2. Designing and executing experiments to collect relevant data.
3. Developing a machine learning model capable of handling orientation variations in IMU data to accurately detect eating gestures.

## Project Scope
1. **Literature Review**: Analyze existing approaches for food intake detection and gain familiarity with IMU sensor applications in this context.
2. **Experimentation**: Design and conduct experiments for data collection.
3. **Model Development**: Develop and evaluate a machine learning model suited for detecting food intake gestures based on the collected IMU data.
